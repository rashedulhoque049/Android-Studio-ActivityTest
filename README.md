# Android-Studio-IntentActivityTest

There is an edittext box and whatever you type in it will be passed to a new activity page upon the button click and search that input on google and show google search results for that input. 
A simple test project which demonstrates the use of intent on Android Studio. 
From one activity jump to another activity by creating intent and passing any data/object/string from one activity to another.
